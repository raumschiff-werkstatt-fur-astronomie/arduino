A general introduction to solar flares
======================================

From https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/what-is-a-solar-flare:

A solar flare is an intense burst of radiation coming from the release of
magnetic energy associated with sunspots.
Flares are our solar systemâ€™s largest explosive events.
They are seen as bright areas on the sun and they can last from minutes to hours.
We typically see a solar flare by the photons (or light) it releases,
at most every wavelength of the spectrum. The primary ways we monitor flares are in x-rays and extreme
ultraviolet light.

Flares are the sites where particles (electrons, protons, and heavier particles) are accelerated.

The X-ray flux emitted by the sun is used to monitor solar activity. The spacecraft series GOES include
an x-ray instrument that provides data
near to real-time, an is updated every minute.
During an x-ray flare the x-ray flux increases rapidly over 10 - 20 minutes to a maximum,
before returning to background levels over another 1 to 2 hours.

An example showing the solar flux monitoring over almost three days. All the peaks are solar flares.

When the x-ray flux exceeds M1 (1 x 10E-5 Watts/m2), the solar flare alert starts flashing to indicate
that a solar flare is in progress (very exciting!).
